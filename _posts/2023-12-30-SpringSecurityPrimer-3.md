## Overview

Having gained insights into the configuration of Spring Security in a Spring Boot application, let's explore essential helper classes pivotal for authentication using Spring Security.

## SecurityContextHolder

The `SecurityContextHolder` class is responsible for storing authenticated user information, including the username, user authorities, and other identification details. By default, it utilizes a `ThreadLocal` to store user details, making the `SecurityContext` consistently available to methods in the same thread.

## SecurityContext

`SecurityContextImpl` implements the `SecurityContext` interface and can be obtained from `SecurityContextHolder`. It encapsulates the `Authentication` of the currently authenticated user. Spring Securityâ€™s `FilterChainProxy` ensures the proper clearing of the `SecurityContext`.

## Authentication

`AbstractAuthenticationToken` implements the `Authentication` interface. It is input to `AuthenticationManager` to authenticate user credentials or retrieve the current user from the `SecurityContext`. Key elements of `Authentication` include:

- `principal`: Identifies the user, often an instance of `UserDetails` during username/password authentication.
- `credentials`: Typically a password, often cleared post-authentication to prevent leakage.
- `authorities`: Represents high-level permissions granted to the user, obtainable from `Authentication.getAuthorities()`.

## AuthenticationManager

The `AuthenticationManager` instance is responsible for authenticating HTTP requests. The widely used implementation is `ProviderManager`.

## ProviderManager

`ProviderManager` maintains a list of `AuthenticationProvider` instances for authentication.

## AuthenticationProvider

`AuthenticationProvider` has various implementations, with `DaoAuthenticationProvider` being one of the most commonly used. It performs the actual authentication.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this post has illuminated the various components crucial for user authentication using Spring Security. We've explored the storage of user details in `SecurityContextHolder`, the pivotal role of `AuthenticationManager` in authenticating HTTP requests, and the diverse implementations of `AuthenticationProvider`, including the widely-used `DaoAuthenticationProvider`.
